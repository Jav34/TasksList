# Draft outline of the stages of project implementation
## 1. Requirements Analysis and Design:
- Understanding business and functional requirements. 
- Creation of project requirements documentation. 
- UI/UX design. 

## 2. Sprint Planning:
- Dividing the project into fixed-length sprints.
- Defining tasks to be performed in each sprint based on requirements and design. 
- Assigning tasks to team members (in this case is just one developer)

## 3. Backend implementation:
- Begin with the implementation of the basic backend structure (data models, authorization, APIs).
- Implementation of individual functionalities as required. 

## 4. Frontend implementation:
- begin by creating the basic structure of the frontend (page layout, UI components...)
- Implementation of UI, communication with backend. 

## 5. Testing and Optimization:
- Unit, integration and interaction testing of the app.
- Corrections and optimization of code based on test results. 

## 6. Integration and Debugging:
- Frontend to backend integration.
- Debugging and troubleshooting component interactions. 

## 7. Deployment and Acceptance Testing:
- Containerization of the app using Docker. 
- Deploying the app on a test platform for acceptance testing. 

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance:
- Monitoring the performance of the app in prod.
- Error handling and possible updates based on user feedback.
